# hello-world
This is my first github repository.

I am starting to work with github, so working through the hello-world tutorial seems like a good idea.

The tutorial says I should write a bit about myself here. I am an experienced space scientist. I have flown instruments in orbit around Earth, out past Pluto aboard New Horizons, and now in orbit around Jupiter aboard the Juno spacecraft. I have gotten to help assemble these instruments. These instruments are assembled by technicians who are real craftsmen and artist. They are rightfully proud of these instruments, so they don't like us PhD's touching the hardware too much. I got around that by running our calibration laboratory, so I got to install the instruments and take them apart when they didn't work. (We always got them working before sending them to the spacecraft.)
My primary jobs were to calibrate these instruments prior to launch and then analyze the data that came down to understand the space plasma environment. Writing proposals was also a big part of the job, but usually not as fun.
I hope this is enough for the hello-world repository, with probably no one ever reads.
